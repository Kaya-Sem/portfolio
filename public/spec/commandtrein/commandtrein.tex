		Commandtrein is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to access and display timetables and route information for NMBS (Belgian Railways) directly from your terminal. It provides real-time train schedules, connections between stations, and transit disturbance information through a user-friendly terminal interface. The tool integrates with the iRail API to fetch live data and offers features like station search, timetable viewing, and route planning with customizable shortcuts for frequent routes.

\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}
Commandtrein is a CLI tool that helps users find train connections in Belgium. It was developed to provide quick and easy access to NMBS train schedules and route information directly from the terminal. The project aims to simplify the process of checking train timetables and planning journeys for
Belgian rail users. At the time of writing, I was a student at Ghent University and used the train to get to campus daily. Other students who liked the terminal were also interested in such a tool.

\subsection{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Timetables}: Retrieve and display current timetables for any NMBS station
	\item \textbf{Route Planning}: Get detailed connections and travel times between stations
	\item \textbf{Shortcuts}: Configure and use shortcuts for frequently used routes
	\item \textbf{Transit Disturbances}: View current transit issues and planned works
	\item \textbf{Interactive Interface}: User-friendly terminal UI with detailed information display
\end{itemize}

\section{Technologies Used}
\subsection{Core Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Programming Language}: Go
	\item \textbf{Frameworks \& Libraries}:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Bubbletea (TUI framework)
		      \item Cobra (CLI framework)
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{External APIs}: iRail API for Belgian train data
	\item \textbf{Tools}:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item GitHub Actions for CI/CD
		      \item YAML for configuration
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Details}

\subsection{Data Flow}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item User input is processed through the CLI interface
	\item Commands are parsed and validated
	\item API requests are made to iRail for relevant data
	\item JSON responses are parsed and transformed
	\item Data is displayed in a formatted table using Bubbletea
	\item User can interact with the displayed information
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{API Integration}: Handling various API response formats and error cases

	      The iRail API was not a joy to work with. The JSON responses it provides are deeply nested and quite long. An average response for a connection between two stations can be thousands of lines long and I've seen nesting up to 25 levels deep. Not
	      fun to parse or read.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Solution: I complained loads but managed to work with it. I just hope nothing ever breaks or changes because I do not want to touch that API again. (It is somewhat hypermedia driven which is cool.)
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Terminal UI}: Creating an interactive and responsive interface that adapts to narrow terminal sizes.
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Solution: Adapted Bubbletea tables and termsize listening.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility}: Ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Solution: Implemented platform-specific builds for Go using GitHub Actions
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Thoughts on CLI Libraries}

While working on this project, I encountered limitations with existing CLI libraries that didn't align with my needs. Popular libraries like Cobra enforce specific patterns for creating and interacting with CLI applications. While this standardization makes sense from a maintainability perspective, it can be restrictive.

The hierarchical command structure common in these libraries, where arguments must follow a strict command tree pattern, felt overly constraining for my use case. I found myself frequently wanting to implement more flexible command parsing patterns that weren't possible within these frameworks' constraints. This experience highlighted the trade-off between standardized patterns and implementation flexibility in CLI development.

Given these limitations, I am considering developing my own CLI framework that emphasizes scriptability and customization. The goal would be to create a more flexible system that allows developers to define their own command parsing patterns and interaction models, while still maintaining good practices and conventions. This would enable more creative and tailored CLI applications without sacrificing maintainability.
